# bazzite-unraid-xfce

Bazzite-Unraid is a project for running Bazzite-Arch with XFCE on Unraid via Distrobox.

Bazzite-Arch is built from [arch-toolbox](https://github.com/ublue-os/toolboxes/tree/main/toolboxes/arch-toolbox), which ships with [paru](https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru) pre-installed, along with a modified [xdg-utils](https://github.com/KyleGospo/xdg-utils-distrobox-arch) that allows the container to open your host operating system's web browsers and file explorer.

This project modifies the Bazzite-Arch build file to allow for updates and additions to the base image.
